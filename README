Project to port NIRA from MATLAB to Python using SciPy libraries and the CVXOPT optimisation engine. The primary benefit will be to allow those without MATLAB and teh optimisation toolbox to run NIRA. A secondary goal is to develop a more user-friendly GUI to the software than is presently available, although that should not hinder people using it as a script within a larger programme. It is anticipated that most users will be running it in an academic environment and be competent at coding themselves, so a GUI is not a high priority.
